# 👋 Hi! I’m Chirayu Dudhade 

I’ve always been the person who asks “Why?” until I find a solid answer. That curiosity led me to complete my Master’s in Business Analytics at UTS and dive head-first into the world of data.

To me, data isn’t just rows and columns—it’s a story waiting to be told. I specialize in finding the “So What?” in complex datasets. Whether uncovering $610K in revenue leakage or forecasting the next five years of energy exports, my goal is to turn “interesting numbers” into profitable decisions.

**What I do:**

* Bridge the gap: I speak both Data and Business. I can write the SQL query to pull the numbers and explain what they mean for the bottom line.
* Build for clarity: Obsessed with clean, intuitive dashboards. If a stakeholder can’t understand a Power BI report in 10 seconds, I haven’t done my job.
* Solve puzzles: From predictive modeling in Python to process improvement in retail, I love structuring messy business problems into clear, data-driven solutions.

When I’m not in a spreadsheet:
You’ll find me experimenting with visualization techniques, keeping up with the latest BI tools, or exploring Sydney’s best coffee spots. ☕
